# PhonePe-Transaction-Insights

The Indian digital payments story has truly captured the worldâ€™s imagination. From the largest towns to the remotest villages, there is a payments revolution being driven by the penetration of mobile phones, mobile internet and state-of-art payments infrastructure built as Public Goods championed by the central bank and the government. PhonePe started in 2016 and has been a strong beneficiary of the API driven digitisation of payments in India. When we started , we were constantly looking for definitive data sources on digital payments in India without much success. As a way of giving back to the data and developer community, we decided to open the anonymised aggregate data sets that demystify the what, why and how of digital payments in India. Licensed under the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 open data license, the PhonePe Pulse Dataset API is a first of its kind open data initiative in the payments space.

# Summary:

1.The insights are created using data extraction and integration of SQL with python(Jupyter notebook) where SQL is used for data analysis. The data visualisation is done using Python and streamlit.

2.The data has transactions made across all the states in India by various users in the years of 2018-2024.
   
3.Following are the nine data frames which were created using all the transactions given:

**Aggregated**

data/aggregated/transaction

data/aggregated/user

data/aggregated/insurance

**Map**

data/map/transaction

data/map/user

data/map/insurance

**Top**

data/top/transaction

data/top/user

data/top/insurance

4.Using these dataframes , few findings have been provided for business case studies, which are as follows:
        
        i.Decoding Transaction Dynamics on PhonePe,
        ii. Transaction Analysis for Market Expansion,
        iii. Insurance Engagement Analysis,
        iv. Transaction Analysis Across States and Districts,
        v. User Registration Analysis,
        vi. Insurance Transactions Analysis.

5.A map has been visualised using the User Registration Analysis case study where it shows the total registrations in each state
